<h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
<p>I've taken major inspiration from webrings and have decided to curate one myself for a project! I will let wiki explain what a webring is here  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring></a> <br>

<p>If the ring is broken, please <a href={{site.github_repo_url}}/issues/new>submit an error report on GitHub</a>.

<h2 id=members>Members ({{site.data.members.size}})</h2>
<ul>
{% for member in site.data.members %}
<li><a href="{{member.url | xml_escape}}">{{member.name | xml_escape | newline_to_br}}</a>{% endfor %}
</ul>
